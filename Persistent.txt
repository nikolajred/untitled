Persistent.
Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns
 multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the
 digits in num until you reach a single digit.

For example:
 persistence(39) === 3 // because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4
                       // and 4 has only one digit

 persistence(999) === 4 // because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126,
                        // 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2

 persistence(4) === 0 // because 4 is already a one-digit number

 Find the stray number
 You are given an odd-length array of integers, in which all of them are the same, except for one single number.

 Complete the method which accepts such an array, and returns that single different number.

 The input array will always be valid! (odd-length >= 3)

 Examples
 [1, 1, 2] ==> 2
 [17, 17, 3, 17, 17, 17, 17] ==> 3
